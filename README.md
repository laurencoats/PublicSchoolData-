# Public School Testing Data
### by Lauren Coats
## Business Problem 
The propose of this project is to create a dashboard for non-technical stake holders to quickly get insight on test score proficiency. 

## Data 
Annual state assessment results are an important academic indicator in a schools and across the education sector. 
Each year, elementary-middle schools administer the Michigan M-STEP exam and are
held accountable by their overall proficiency rates in math and reading in grades 3 through 8. Proficiency rates signal whether
students are mastering the content and academic requirements demanded at their grade level. Compared year over year, they also
provide insight into macro-level trends in academic performance and help us to identify which schools are chronically
underperforming, turning around, or maintaining high levels of achievement.Data was provided by Detroit Public Schools hiring process. The data includes test scores for 3 school for 2 school years, 17/18 and 18/19.  

## SQL 
A MySQL Database was created for the data.

## Power BI Features

The dashboard can be customized by technical and non-technical educational decision makers.  They can use this to drill down on the groups they are most interested in.
